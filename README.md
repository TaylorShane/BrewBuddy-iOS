# iOS-BrewBuddy-App
BrewBuddy is an iOS mobile app built for the homebrewer with handy tools to help create a terrific beer on brew day and beyond.  It consists of three activities: 1. ABV Calculator - by inputting your starting and finishing gravity, this calculates and tells you what percentage of alcohol by volume your beer has.  2. Bottle Calculator - with the bottle calculator you'll know exactly how many bottles you will need on hand to bottle your beer come bottling day.  No more guessing and wasting time either by sanitizing more bottles than you need or having to sanitize a few more while your trying to bottle.  3. Hops Price Index - the price index has a list of the most common hops used by home brewers and displays the price per five pounds and an image of the hop itself.  Check out the video of the app in question and the NinjaMock user interface mock-up.
